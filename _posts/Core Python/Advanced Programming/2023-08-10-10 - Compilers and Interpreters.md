A Compiler is a program that takes source code and converts it into a Byte code. A Byte code is an intermidiate code that can be understood by a language specific interpreter. An interpreter then takes the compiled Byte code and runs it line by line.

In Python, the compiler runs to check the syntax and generate byte code. In Python, the compiler is quiet simple as most of the work is done during interpretation stage itself. Hence Python is an interpretted language. This is different in languages like JAVA, C#.

Python has multiple interpreters like pypy, cpython those are just different implementations of python.
