A decorator is basically just a function that performs some checks on the input function and then calls the input function. A decorator is basically built using function closure. Decorators are used to enforce a behaviour on a function or a method. A decorator can be invoked like `@decorator` and placing it on top of the function that needs to be decorated. The function is passed as an input to decorator function and the result is returned.

```python
# Decorator

def decorator(func):
    print("Inside the decorator function")
    def wrapper():
        print("Inside the wrapper...")
        func()
    return wrapper

@decorator
def print_something():
    print("Hello world!")

print_something()

# Output: Inside the decorator function
# Output: Inside the wrapper...
# Output: Hello world!
```

Here, one thing to note is that the `wrapper()` function should take the same number of argument as the function that is being passed as input to `decorator()` function. So in this case, it should be `print_something`. Since, we know that `print_something` does not return any result, we are not returning anything from wrapper, however, wrapper returns the result of the calling function.

```python

def custom_decorator(func):
    print("Inside Decorator..")
    def wrapper(inp_a):
        print("Inside Wrapper...")
        result = func(inp_a)
        return result
    return wrapper

@custom_decorator
def cus_fn1(x):
    print(f"Value: {x}")

cus_fn1("Shantanu")

# Output: Inside Decorator..
# Output: Inside Wrapper...
# Output: Value: Shantanu
```

The above example can also be replicated without using `@decorator` syntax as shown below.

```Python
cus_fn1 = custom_decorator(cus_fn1)
cus_fn1("Vibhuti")

# Output: Inside Decorator..
# Output: Inside Wrapper...
# Output: Value: Vibhuti
```

Please note that creating a decorator in this way we are restricting it to function with only certain number of parameters, however, we can make use of *\*args* and *\*\*kwargs* to extend a decorator to implement any function.

```python
import time
def timer(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        starttime = time.time()
        res = func(*args, **kwargs)
        stoptime = time.time()
        print(f"Function took {stoptime - starttime} seconds.")
        return res
    return wrapper

@timer
def iter_ls(x):
    for _ in x:
        pass

@timer
def iter_ls2(x, y):
    for _ in x:
        pass
    for _ in y:
        pass

iter_ls([x for x in range(1000000)])
# Output : Function took 0.009792327880859375 seconds.

iter_ls2([x for x in range(1000000)], [x for x in range(1000000)])
# Output : Function took 0.02457880973815918 seconds.
```

> Note: If we are not concerned about the output value of for loop, we can use _ as well as a placeholder for a variable.
