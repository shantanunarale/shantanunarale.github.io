When we execute a Python program, python process is started which attaches python interpretter to the python process. Now a python interpretter can only run concurrent programs i.e. program with multiple threads but one thread running at one time. At minimum the program has atleast one thread that is the main line code that we are running. However, we can spinup another thread and execute it. We need to import `threading` module for the same.

Below is the simple example of Threading.

```python
# 13 - Threading
import threading

def func():
    print("Inside Thread 1....")

t = threading.Thread(target=func)

print("Inside Main Thread")
t.start()
print("Inside Main Thread")
```

The `Thread` class takes in two parameters `target` and `args`. You pass in the function and its arguments to both the parameters respectively. The `args` parameter accepts a tuple. Consider the below example.

```python
def A():
    print("Inside function A.")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Function A ends.")

def B():
    print("Inside function B.")
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Function B ends.")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=A)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=B)

print("In the main thread")
t1.start()
print(f"Thread count is {threading.active_count()}")
t2.start()
print("main thread ends")
```

Here we create two threads `t1` and `t2` pointing to function `A` and function `B`. When we execute the program below is what is going to happen.

1. The main thread will start create the threads and print the message *"In the main thread".*
2. Next Thread 1 `t1` is spun up and it will execute the next line *"Inside Function A"*.
3. As soon as `t1` hangs due to delay, the control is transferred back to main thread and it executes the active thread count which should be *2* as only `t1` and main thread are running.
4. Next Thread 2 `t2` will be started and it will print its first line and sleep for a second.
5. During this time, the control is returned back to main thread and it prints its remaining lines.
6. Now the main thread prints its last line and as soon as the `t1` delay ends, thread becomes active again and prints its remaining lines.
7. At the end `t2` gets the CPU and prints its remaining lines of code.

> Please note that the thread execution is very unpredictable, we cannot really predict if there are other things like IO that will cause the thread1 to pause. Also, there are underlying OS algorithms that can cause threads to pause and start. So the above example can really give us some weired results.

Also take a note of the new function inside the `threading` module which is `threading.active_count()`. This would return the number of active threads.

If we want to make sure that threads wait for the other thread to complete, we can do that using `join()` method as below.

```python
from threading import Lock, Thread, active_count
from time import sleep

def t1(lst, val, dly_val = 1):
    print("Inside Thread 1.")
    lst.append(val)
    sleep(dly_val)

def t2(lst, val, dly_val = 1):
    print("Inside Thread 2.")
    lst.append(val)
    sleep(dly_val)

lst = []
ta = Thread(target=t1, args=(lst, 1))
tb = Thread(target=t2, args=(lst, 2))
tc = Thread(target=t1, args=(lst, 3))

ta.start()
ta.join()
tb.start()
tb.join()
tc.start()
tc.join()

print(lst)
```

The `join` method would wait for the thread to complete before moving to the next statement. So for example, when we start thread ta, the join method `ta.join()` waits for `ta` to complete and only after that executes the next line of code.

The other way of implementing the same is using *lock*. Below is another implementation of the same.

```Python
from threading import Thread, Lock
from time import sleep

def fn_A(lock: Lock):
    lock.acquire()
    print("In Function A")
    sleep(1)
    print("Function A Ending")
    lock.release()
    

def fn_B(lock: Lock):
    lock.acquire()
    print("In function B")
    sleep(1)
    print("Function B ending")
    lock.release()
    

lck = Lock()
t1 = Thread(target=fn_A, args=(lck, ))
t2 = Thread(target=fn_B, args=(lck, ))

t1.start()
t2.start()
```

We can also exchange locks between two functions syncronize there execution.

```python
from threading import Thread, Lock
from time import sleep

def fn_A(inv, val: list, startLock: Lock, endLock: Lock):
    startLock.acquire()
    val.append(inv)
    endLock.release()
    

def fn_B(inv, val: list, startLock: Lock, endLock: Lock):
    startLock.acquire()
    val.append(inv)
    endLock.release()

lst = []
l1 = Lock()
l2 = Lock()
l2.acquire()

t1 = Thread(target=fn_A, args=(1, lst, l1, l2))
t2 = Thread(target=fn_B, args=(2, lst, l2, l1))

t1.start()
t2.start()

print(lst)
```

With this type of programming there is also a chance of deadlock which occurs when two threads wait on each other. A Deadlock is not automatically resolved and program will keep on executin till we kill it.

> Please note that when we are importing a module where we implement threading it is necessarry to implement `thread.join()` at the end of module to prevent incorrect results.
