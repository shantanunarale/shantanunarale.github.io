Interface is a very important concept in the OOPS. An interface is a special abstract class that has all the abstract methods. So the underlying class has to implement all the methods of Interface.

Interface are very important in strongly typed languages like C#, where we can define a type of variable as type of Interface and then set the value of variable with any object that implements the interface like below.

```C#
interface ISampleInterface
{
    void SampleMethod();
}

class ImplementationClass : ISampleInterface
{
    // Explicit interface member implementation:
    void ISampleInterface.SampleMethod()
    {
        // Method implementation.
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare an interface instance.
        ISampleInterface obj = new ImplementationClass();

        // Call the member.
        obj.SampleMethod();
    }
}
```

However, like abstract class, python does not supports notion of interface and since Python is loosely typed and has Duck Typing the above example is not valid in Python and hence Interface are not so important. However, we can replicate Interface functionality in Python by raising *NotImplemented* error in each method and can suffix the class name with interface as below.

```Python
class SampleInterface:
    def sampleMethod(self):
        raise NotImplemented("Implement in Base Class")
    
class SampleClass(SampleInterface):
    def sampleMethod(self):
        print("In Sample Class")

sc = SampleClass()
sc.sampleMethod()
```

In case of multiple inheritance, the interface must come at the end after inheriting from base classes. Interface should be the last parent.
