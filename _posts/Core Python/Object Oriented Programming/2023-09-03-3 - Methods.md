In the notion of OOPs, a class usually has attributes (aka the data elements that store instance specific data) and methods that operate on the data.

Methods are nothing but specialized functions that can be called on the instance of a class. You can call the method using . operator. A method like a function can accept none, one or many parameters and can return a value as well. Below is the example of a custom method.

```python
class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, taste, hasseeds) -> None:
        self.taste = taste
        self.hasseeds = hasseeds
        self.fruitcut = False

    def cutFruit(self):
        self.fruitcut = True
    
    def fruitstatus(self):
        print("Fruit is cut" if self.fruitcut else "Fruit is uncut.")

Banana = Fruit("Sweet", False)
Apple = Fruit("SweetSour", True)

Banana.cutFruit()

Banana.fruitstatus()
# Output : Fruit is cut
Apple.fruitstatus()
# Output : Fruit is uncut
```

In the class Fruit, we have methods cutFruit and fruitStatus that operate on the attribute of Fruit. The instance method need to take one argument i.e. self in order for it to work on the instance of attributes. Python throws an TypeError if self is not a parameter of method and we try to call it at instance level.
