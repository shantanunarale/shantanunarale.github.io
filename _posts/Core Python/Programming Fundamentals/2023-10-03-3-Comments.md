There are two types of comments in Python.

- Single line comment denoted by \#. Example is 

```python
print('hello') # This is a comment
```

- Multiline comment is in triple quote ''' or """

```python
''' We are printing multiline comment
This is line 2.'''
print("hello")
```

Do not overuse the comments and write only where it is necessarry and helping understand the code. Obvious things should not be commented.
