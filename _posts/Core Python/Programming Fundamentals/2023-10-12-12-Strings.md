Strings are immutable objects in python. Python does not support a concept of chars. It has strings as the only data type.

Strings supports indexes like lists, however, unlike lists, you cannot set any element of a string using indexes as strings are immutable.

```python
inpstr = "hello sTring"

# You can use indexes to access an element of string like below.

print(inpstr[0], inpstr[-1], inpstr[2])

#Unlike list, string does not support assignment of an element due to its immutability.
'''
inpstr[1] = 's'
print(inpstr)
'''
```

You can also use functions like len on string like on the list. Strings also support below important methods 

- Count : This method returns number of occurrences of a given character . This is similart to count in the list.

```python
inpstr = "hello sTring"

print(inpstr.count('H'))
if inpstr.count('l') > 1:
    print("Its a L string")
else:
    print("Not a L string")
```
- As an alternative to count, string also supports in and not in operators similart to list.

```python
inpstr = "hello sTring"

print(inpstr.count('H'))
if 'l' in inpstr and 'z' not in inpstr:
    print("Its a L string")
else:
    print("Not a L string")
```
- find() : This method is similar to index method in the list, it returns the first index of the character passed in. However, unlike index, it does not throw error if the character is not found instead returns -1.

```python
inpstr = "Hello string"

print(inpstr.find("s")) # Returns 6
print(inpstr.find("z")) # Returns -1
```
- replace(search_str, repl_str) : This method accepts two parameters. It replaces every occurence of search_str with repl_str.

```python
inpstr = "Hello"
print(inpstr.replace("l", "L"))
# The output is HeLLo
```
- lower() : This method converts all the chars to lower case.
- upper() : This method converts all the chars to upper case.
- capitalize() : Converts the first letter caps.

In Python, you can also use multiline strings. Similar to multiline comments, if a multiline comment within (""" or ''') is used in print statement or assigned to variable or an expression it is a multiline string. To escape a special charater you can use \ like below.

```python
str = """This is a 
multiline string escape char is \"
in pyton"""

print(str)
# The output is the multiline string.
```

From version 3.6 of Python, it also supports f string. An f string is one where you can build a string and do inplace substition of a variable of expression in the string as below. f string should start with f or F outside string.

```python
name = "Shantanu"
age = 31
fstring = f"My name is {name} and age is {age}."

print(fstring)
# Output : My name is Shantanu and age is 31
```

You can also use an expression like {1+1} in the f string, the result is automatically converted to a string without using str() function.
