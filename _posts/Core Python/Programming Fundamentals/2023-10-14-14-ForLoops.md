Python supports for loops and they are the most basic and widely used looping construct in python. In a for loop, you usually tell how many number of times you want to run a loop. Below is the basic syntax of for loop

```python
# Basic Syntax
for i in range(10):
    print(f"We are in for loop at index {i}")
# Runs the loop 10 times with i from 0 to 9.
```
Here we are using a range function to tell the for loop how many number of times do we need to run it. For every iteration, the for loop i is incremented. Variable i is initialized at zero and incremented till 9. 

### Range function

 Range function is used in the for loop to generate the range of values for which for loop needs to be itterated upon. There are two variations of range function.

 - range(num) : In this case, the for loop would start and 0 and would run until index is less than num, as soon as index reaches the num, the loop is exited. As in the above example, the for loop starts at 0 and runs till i = 9 on the next increment it exits.

 - range(start, stop, step) : In this case, you need to pass the start value, the value till which the loop will be executed and step is the increment. For below example, we start at 0 so i is initialized at 0 and incremented by 2 till i < 11. Range function can also accept negative start, stop and step.
  ```python
  # Range function.

print("Even numbers from 0 to 10 are")
for i in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(i, end=" ")
# Result : 0 2 4 6 8 10

# Range can also be negative
print("Even numbers from 0 to -10 are")
for i in range(0, -11, -2):
    print(i)
# Result : 0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10    
```
The use case of this type of looping is to loop on any iterable like list, string or tupple.

```python
# Reversing string using for loop
s = "Shantanu Narale"
lst = []

for i in range(-1, -(len(s)+1), -1):
    lst.append(s[i])

new_str = "".join(lst)
print(new_str)

# Itterating on list and tuple to get alternate element.
lst = [1, 2, 3.5, True, "Shantanu"]
tup = 1, 2, 3.5, True, "Narale"

for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
    print(lst[i])

for i in range(0, len(tup), 2):
    print(tup[i])
```

Range function can also be used to generate list or tuple as below independantly without using for loop.

```python
# Using Range to generate tuple, list and string

lst = list(range(65, 91, 1))
tup = tuple(range(97, 123, 1))
str_list = [] 
for idx in range(len(lst)):
    str_list.append(chr(lst[idx]))
print(lst, tup, "".join(str_list), sep="\n")
```
### Iterate on an iterable

To itterate on an iterable like list or tuple or str, there are other ways as mentioned below.

```python
# Direct Iteration on a iterable

lst = [1, 2, 4, 6.5, False, "Name"]

for element in lst:
    print(element)
```
This works similar to a foreach loop in C#. You can directly iterate on a iterable without taking care of index. In the above example, element holds each value in the list for every iteration. The downside of this is you loose the index position. To achieve this, python provides us with **enumerate** keyword that can be used as below.

```python
# Replace function using for loop
# Replace all the occurrences of l with L
s = "Hello World!"
lst = list(s)

for idx, element in enumerate(lst):
    if element == "l":
        lst[idx] = "L"

print("".join(lst))
# Result : HeLLo WorLd!
```

In the above example, the first variable holds the index and second holds the exact element in iterable. 

### Keywords (continue, break and pass)

Python has three specialized keywords that can be used in the for loop.

- break : When used inside the loop, the control will be transferred out of the loop. In short, it breaks the loop.
- continue : When this keyword is encountered, the next statements are ignored and itteration continues.
- pass : This is like a placeholder keyword. This can be used to complete the syntax, when the loop or condition needs to be executed but nothing is to be done.

Below is the example of all three keywords.

```python
# break keyword and continue
# Find first occurence of l in the below string

s = "Hello World!"        

for i, element in enumerate(s):
    if element == "l":
        break

print(i) # result : 2

# print each word of a string except l

s = "Hello World!"

for i, element in enumerate(s):
    if element == 'l':
        continue
    print(element, end="") # result : Heo word

# pass keyword can be used if nothing needs to be done

for i in range(100):
    pass # Does nothing
```

### Nested loops

Like all other programing languages, you can also use loop inside loop in python also called as nested loops as below.

```python
# Nested for loops

for i in range(10):    
    for j in range(10): # This loop is executed 10 * 10 = 100 times
        print(i, j, sep=" | ")
```

### For else

Python also has a unique feature, it supports a new construct called as for-else. Consider a below example, if you want to find if string has a word l and print a message that l exists or not exists. To do this through for loop without using for else, the code would look like below.

```python
s = input("Enter a string: ")
exists = False

for element in s:
    if element == 'l':
        exists = True
        break

print("Contains l" if exists else "Not Contains l")
```

In the above example, we create a boolean variable exists that dictates wether if part of else part of the last print statement is executed. If the exists is set to True, we immidiately break the loop. For else can be used to simplify this construct as below.

```python

# for else, if the string contains l then print contains l else not contains
s = input("Enter a string: ")

for ele in s:
    if ele == 'l':
        print("Contains l")
        break
else:
    print("Not contains l")

```

In the above scenario, if the loop completes **without encountering break** only then the else part of the loop is executed, if the break is executed then the else part of the loop is skipped. The for else thus is a short hand of the original example mentioned above that uses a boolean variable exists. For else construct mandatorily requires a break statement and else part is executed only *if the break is not encountered* in the execution and *itteration* is completed.
