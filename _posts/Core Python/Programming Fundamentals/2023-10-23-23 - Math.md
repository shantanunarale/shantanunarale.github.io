There are number of Math functions available in Python. The commonly used math functions in Python are.

- abs : gives absolute value.
- min
- max
- sum
- round : rounds the decimal with number of digits specified. If number of elements not specidied by default returns int.

> min and max functions also accepts key similar to sorted function. Also, for min and max, the function accepts any itterable object or you can directly pass the values. 

```python
ls = [1, 2, 3, 4]
dc = {2: "Shantanu", 3: "Akshara"}

def key_fn(inp_dict):            
    return inp_dict[1]

min_tup = min(dc.items(), key=key_fn)
ndc = {min_tup[0]: min_tup[1]}
print(ndc)
# Output: {3: "Akshara"}

print(min(4, 5, 1))
print(max(ls))
print(sum(ls))
print(round(1.234, 2))
# Output: {3: 'Akshara'}
# 1
# 4
# 10
# 1.23
```

Python also has math module that supports mathematical functions like sin, cos etc. It also has math.pi which is declaration of pi.

random module in Python contains some important functions like.

- random() : Returns random float between 0 and 1 both inclusive
- randint() : Returns int between start and stop both inclusive.
- randrange() : Returns int between start and stop with stop not included and also has a step paramter. 
- choice() : returns a random element from list.
