Python lists has a method called sort. This method sorts the list in place as shown below. This function does in place sort and hence returns None.

> In Python, every function would return a value even if you don't have return keyword it still returns None.

```python
# list sort
lst = [4, 2, 0, 3, 1]
lst.sort()

print(lst)
#Output : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This function also has reverse flag which when set to True will do a descending sort as below.

```python
lst.sort(reverse=True)

print(lst)
#Output : [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

Sort also has an argument called Key that takes in function as an input that can be used to define the sorting logic as shown below.

```python
# Nested List sort
def key_fn(inp: list) -> int:
    """Used in sort. Returns last element of list."""
    return inp[(len(inp) - 1)]
nlist = [[3, 4], [5, 6], [2, 3]]
nlist.sort(key=key_fn, reverse=True)
print(nlist)

#Output: [[5, 6], [3, 4], [2, 3]]
```

The above example has nested list, by default without key the list is sorted on the first element of nested list. The *key_fn* returns the last elelement of the list so that sorting occurs on that.

Like lists, othere types like tuple, set and dic do not have sort method. There is another function in Python that takes an iterable and returns a list called sorted.

The sorted function is similar to sort function but it does not do inplace modification and instead returns a list like below.

```python
# Dic sort
def dic_sort(ele: tuple) -> str:
    return ele[1]
dic = {1: "Shantanu", 2: "Vibhuti", 3: "Akshara"}

print(sorted(dic.items(), reverse=True, key= dic_sort))
# Output : [(2, 'Vibhuti'), (1, 'Shantanu'), (3, 'Akshara')]
```
