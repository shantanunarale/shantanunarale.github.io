 Slices is another feature specific to python. Slices as the name suggest help to slice an iterable like string, tuple or list. Basically, the way slicing helps is it can generate a new list, string or a tuple from the original one with the elements those are needed. The basic format of slicing a data is [:], when you use : within [] it indicates that you are slicing data. Below is how the basic example of slicing.

 ```python
 # Basic slicing a list

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
tup = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
string = "Shantanu Narale"
# Access elements uptill index 7

new_lst = lst[:7]
new_tup = tup[:7]
new_str = string[:7]
print(new_lst, new_tup, new_str)
# Result : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) Shantan
```

In the above example, we have a list with 10 elements from 1 to 9, [:7] tells python to generate a new list from start position till 7th index *(excluding 7th index)* and hence we get the above result.

### Syntax of slice

The syntax of slice is as follows
[start_index, stop_index, step]. The syntax of slice is similar to the range function. The first is the start index, which tells the starting position or starting index of slice, stop_index is the index till we need to slice the data excluding that index and the step is increment that we need to make. For example, in the same example mentioned above, if we need all the even elements starting from position 1, the code would look like below.

```python
# Even elements from position 1
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
new_lst = lst[1:10:2]
print(new_lst)

# Result : [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
We have mentioned 1 as starting point of the slice and we are continuing till index 2 with step size of 2. One thing to note is, in case if the stop index is outside the range of the list, the slicing does not generates error.

### Negative slicing

One thing to note here, is it is not mandatory to have a positive step size. In fact, a negative start_index, stop_index and step_size or a combination of all is also valid. One common way of reversing a list or tuple or string is using **[::-1]** which will reverse the list as below.

```python
# Reversing a list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
new_lst = lst[::-1]
print(new_lst)

#Result : [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

### Understanding the principal of slicing

Consider a below list with all its indexes

|**List**| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Positive Index**| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|**Negative Index**| -10 | -9 | -8 | -7 | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |

> For positive step : Follow --> direction

>For negative step : Follow <-- direction

It doesn't matter if you provide a negative start and positive step or vice versa. The slice will start from the that index till the stop in the direction you (negative/positive step) you mention. For example 

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
new_lst = lst[-1:0:-1]
print(new_lst)

# Result : [6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
```
In this example, the start is at index -1 and need to stop at index 0 (not including 0), Since, the step is negative, we can go back till index zero from -1 and hence this gives a valid result.

**If the stop index cannot be achieved in the direction of the step, slicing produce blank list.**

Below are few more examples of slicing.

```python
# Slicing combinations
# Positive start, negative stop and negative step
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
new_lst = lst[5:-9:-1]
print(new_lst)

# Positive start, negative stop and positive step
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
new_lst = lst[5:-1:1]
print(new_lst)

# negative start, positive stop and positive step
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
new_lst = lst[-5:10:1]
print(new_lst)

# negative start, positive stop and negative step
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
new_lst = lst[-5:0:-1]
print(new_lst)
```
