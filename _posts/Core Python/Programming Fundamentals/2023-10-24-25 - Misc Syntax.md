Python supports comprehensions. Comprehension is a way of defining a list or set a tuple inline. For example, if you need to create a list with 100 elements you can do it as below.

```python
ls = []

for ele in range(100):
    ls.append(ele)
```

With comprehension the same thing can be done as below.

```python
ls = [ele for ele in range(100)]
```

Moreover, you can add an if or nested for and also generate a customized list or a nested list as follows.

```python
nlist = [[i, j] for i in range (10) for j in range(10)]
print(nlist)
# Output: [[0, 0], [0, 1], ...

elist = [i for i in range(100) if i % 2 == 0]
```

Similarly you can also generate a set or a dictionary.

```python
st = {x[0] for x in nlist} # Generates a set
dc = {x[0]: x[1] for x in nlist} # Generates dict.
```

Python also supports multiple assignments and decoding. You can assign multiple variables with a single value in python and can decompose a tuple or a list as below.

```python
x = y = 2 # Multiple assignment

a, b = 0, 1
a, b, c = [0, 1, 2]
a, b, c = (0, 1, 2) # Supports both tuple and list
```
The first line of string in a function **comments in """** is called docstring and is used by intellisense in VS and in help function as below.

```python
def fnc():
    """This docstring is reflected in help."""
    print("Do Nothing")

fnc()
```
