Tuples are immutable datatype in python meaning when you create a tuple you cannot change the value of tuple. You can create a tuple with different types like list.

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3.5, True, "Shantanu", None)

print(tup)
```

You can also use tuple functiont to convert any data type to tuple as below.

```python
ls = [1, 2, 3]
tp = tuple(ls)
```

You can read the element of tuple using indexes but cannot modify the element of an tuple using indexes. Tuples support both positive and negative indexes. You cannot modify a tuple since its imutable, in order to do so you need to create another tuple and re-allocate it to same.

```python
tp = (1, 2, 3.5, True, False)
print(tp[1], tp[-4]) # Output : 2 True

tp[1] = 3 # This is invalid, to achieve this do the following.

tp_tm = tp[0], 3, tp[2], tp[3], tp[4]
tp = tp_tm
```

Since, a variable can also be defined with parenthesis like
`x = (1)`

In order, to create a tuple with single element you can define as below.
`x = (1, )`. Tuple can also be created in below manner.

```python
# Types of tuple declarations

tp = 1, 2
tp_1 = 1,
tp_nes = 1, 2, (3, 4)
tp_col = (1, 2, 3, [True, False])
```

You can also use, add + and multiply * with tuple. + will merge two tuples to create a new one and * will replicate the value of tuple n number of times as below.

```python
tp = 1, 
print(tp * 5) # Result : (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

tpa = (1, 2)
tpb = (3, 4)
print(tpa + tpb) # Result : (1, 2, 3, 4)
```
Tuple also supports len function as well as in and not in operator like string and list.

```python
# Use of len function.
tup = (1, 2, 3, (4, 5))
print(len(tup), len(tup[-1]))
# output : 4 2

# Use of in
tup = (1, 2, 3, (4, 5))

print("Exists") if 2 in tup else print("Not Exists")

# output : Exists
```

Tuple also supports count and index method similar to list. Count returns number of occurence of an element and index returns the first index position of that element.

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)

print(tup.count(2), tup.index(4))
'''
print(tup.index(5)) # Returns error.
'''
```
